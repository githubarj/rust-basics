two data subsets: scalar and compound
rust is statically types so we must know all values of variables at compile time
in areas where many types are possible we must add a type annotation - let guess : u32 = "42".parse().expect("not a number");
Scalar types - respresents a single value 
integers
booleans
characters
floating-point numbers

Integer is a number without a fractional component
types of integers
8-bit - signed = i8 unsigned = u8
16-bit - i16 u16
32-bit
64bit
128-bit
256-bit
arch - isize usize
signes and unsigned means whether a number will ever be negative or will forever be positive - i.e have a sign
each variant if it is a signed variant can store numbers from -(2^n-1) to (2^n-1) - 1. so i8 can store from -128 to 127
each unsigned variant can store numbers from 0 to (2n-1) so u8 - 0 to 255
