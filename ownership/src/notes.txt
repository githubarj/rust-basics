A string is made up of three parts - the pointer to the memory athat holds the contants of the string
                                    - a lenght and a capacity
- This group is stored on  the stack - ponter points to th emoemory on the heap that stored the contents of the string
lenght shows how much memoery in bytes the contants of the string are currently using. while the capacity
is the total mount of memory in bytes that the string has received from the allocator


when you assign complex data types to other variables, it copies the pointer, lenght and capacity not the heap memory
rust therefore deems the inital variable as nolonger valid

if we do want to copy the data in the heap we can use a method called clone

copy can be implemented by the integer types, character types, boolean types and tupes if they only 
contain types that also implement copy
